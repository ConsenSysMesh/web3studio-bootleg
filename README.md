Welcome to the near future. This repo is the home of **Bootleg** ðŸ‘¢ðŸ¦µ. This is
the latest project from the [Consensys Web3Studio](https://consensys.net/web3studio/) team.
We are beginning development on this exciting new idea and you can follow the
latest updates here through GitHub. Please join the discussion, create issues, and get involved!

Read more about the project in the latest article about Bootleg on [Medium](https://link.medium.com/ZgnzmtPMrT)

## Project overview

This repo holds the code and development assets for the Bootleg SDK. The repo and many of the high level concepts in this project all pay homage to the original article about the idea published on Medium (link above). Whenever possible we have attempted to use more generic terms in our code and domain models so that as much code from this repo can be re-used, shared, re-purposed by anyone. We have done our best but it is a tradeoff between making something we feel embodies the spirit of the idea and speculating about would/would not be useful should someone decied to take our code and run with it.

# Orientation

## Packages

This is a monorepo that contains the projects that make bootleg rock ðŸŽ¸. You can find
the code for all of them in in the [`packages`](packages) folder.

You'll notice two prefixes. `bootleg` projects are directly related to the fictional
bootleg app, or the smart contracts it uses. `helix` projects are related to a system to
create non-transferable digital native assets, basically blockchain DRM.

### [`bootleg-tokens`](packages/bootleg-tokens)

This is where you can find the smart contracts for the bootleg token itself. This is where you
would want to look if you want to use our pay-it-backwards tokens in your dApp.

### [`bootleg-app-contracts`](packages/bootleg-app-contracts)

Here lies the smart contracts used by our fictional app. It's a great reference
implementation for your Bootleg-esk dApp.

### [`helix-crypto`](packages/helix-crypto)

Where the rubber hits the road. A phenomenal library to encrypt and then cryptographically
watermark an asset to allow copyright holders to find who leaked their content.

### [`helix-contracts`](packages/helix-contracts)

Reference contracts that the Helix system uses to make everything trustless.

### [`examples`](packages/examples)

Everything comes together here. This is a simulated environment where you can see how to wire
everything up and even tweak with some parameters for your dApp.

### [`notebooks`](packages/examples/notebooks/)

Early simulations of the pay-it-backward model.

## Some other notable items...
[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) file contains drawings and description of the technical details of the project.
