### Project Nutshell -- What we're exploring right now and where to find the work:

The bootleg project is primarily about embodying a token design pattern we call "pay-it-backward" into a user experience that shows the unique capabilities of the pattern in a way that is compelling and potentially worth pursuing by any number of organizations as a new venture. At the very least, the embodyment should inspire and expand the the perspective of developers, designers and entrepreneurs and hopefully lead to derivative ideas or entirely new ideas leading to unique and powerful new ventures.

The following is the big picture of the project and our way of keeping track of the epics and issues in this project as a snapshot with links to the key epics (and some issues).
