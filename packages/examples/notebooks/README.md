# Jupyter notebooks

## Installing

Recommended method... https://jupyter.org/install

You may need to install other tools (like graphviz) to render some notebook content.
Install the package first https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/ (or use homebrew)

If you run into errors about the graphviz package not being found. This was a helpful article https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064304/runtimeerror-make-sure-the-graphviz-executables-are-on-your-systems-path-aft

## Rules of the road

It is likely easier to create a copy of a notebook and edit your own version than to try and deal with merging notebook changes from two different people who have edited the same notebook. When in doubt, make a copy and then merge changes later, manually using copy/paste.
