# Introduction

Cryptol version 2 makes some changes based on suggestions from the user
community and lessons learned by the Cryptol design team. These include syntax
changes and some extensions to the type system. Perhaps the the most
disruptive change for current Cryptol programmers is that Cryptol version 2
interprets sequences in "big endian" mode, rather than "little endian."

Current versions of Cryptol version 1 come with a "modernize" command to
convert a Cryptol version 1 file to Cryptol version 2. The conversion is not
complete, however, and no attempt is made to change the logic of the program
that may depend on endianness, so careful human review is still needed. The
Cryptol command is

    :modernize <infile> <outfile>

## Summary of Changes

Here's a short summary of the syntax changes made in Cryptol version 2:

# New Features in Cryptol version 2

## Sequence Literals

In Cryptol version 1, `[0 ..]:[inf][n]` constructs an infinitely long list of
elements wrapping in `n` bits. In version 2, the `..` syntax creates a finite
list that halts before the wrapping would occur.

In version 2, use the `...` syntax to construct an infinitely long sequence.
One additional change: in version 1 `[0 ..]` constructs the sequence
`[0 1 0 1 0 1]`, and in version 2, `[0 ...]` constructs the sequence `[0, 0, 0, ...]`.
To produce the list of alternating ones and zeros, specify the width of the
elements, as in:

    Cryptol> [0 ... ]:[_][1]
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...]

Finally, version 1 used `--` for decreasing sequences, but version 2 uses the
difference between the first two elements to define the step between elements in
the sequence, as in:

    Cryptol> [10, 9 .. 0]
    [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    Cryptol> [6, 4 .. 1]
    [6, 4, 2]

## Layout

Version 1 of Cryptol used curly braces to delimit blocks and semicolons to
separate expressions. In version 2, Cryptol has _layout_-based syntax which
uses indentation to delimit blocks and `\` to indicate line continuation.

Where in Cryptol version 1 we might write:

    caesar : {n} ([8], String n) -> String n;
    caesar (s, msg) = [| shift x || x <- msg |] where {
        map     = ['A' .. 'Z'] <<< s;
        shift c = map @ (c - 'A');
    };

in version 2 would become:

    caesar : {n} ([8], String n) -> String n
    caesar (s, msg) = [ shift x | x <- msg ]
        where map     = ['A' .. 'Z'] <<< s
              shift c = map @ (c - 'A')

## Module System

The beginning of a Cryptol file can declare that it defines a module:

    module Vector where

and can import another module:

    import Math

Note that the filename for a module should correspond to the module's name with
a `.cry` extension. This allows Cryptol to locate imported modules.

Definitions within a module are public by default, but can be hidden from other
modules like this:

    private internalConstant = 0x55
            anotherInternalConstant = 0x66
    externalConstant=0x77

Whenever names might be ambiguous, they can be disambiguated with the
`::` syntax (using a qualified import using "as"):

    import ExternalModule as eModule
    ...
    functionName = ...         // shadows external definition
    eModule::functionName xs   // accesses external definition

## Multi-way If-Then-Else

Cryptol version 2 supports a "case-statement"-like multi-way branch:

    x = if y % 2 == 0 then 1
         | y % 3 == 0 then 2
         | y % 5 == 0 then 3
         else 7

## First-class Type Variables

In Cryptol version 1, type variables, such as the first argument to `take`,
were special-cased and could not be written in Cryptol itself, but had to be
part of built-in functions. In Cryptol version 2, the named type variables
defined in a function's signature can be referred to when that function is
called, either positionally, or by name. This has allowed many of the
previously built-in functions to be defined in a Cryptol "prelude" file. You
can examine this file by running the Cryptol tool with no argument, and then
typing `:e`. We suggest you not edit this file, however. Here is the definition
of `take`, a previously built-in Cryptol function:

    take : {front,back,elem} (fin front) => [front +
                                             back] elem -> [front] elem
    take (x # _) = x

Since programmers usually think of `take` as a one-argument function (the
number of elements to take from the head of the list), that argument (`front`)
has been defined first in the signature of `take`. This lets us call it like
this:

    take`{3}xs

Which does the same as the Cryptol version 1 call `take(3,xs)`.

Here is the signature for the (still) built-in `split`:

    split : {parts, each, a} (fin each) => [parts *
                                            each]a -> [parts][each]a

and here is how `groupBy` is defined in terms of `split`:

    groupBy : {each,parts,elem} (fin each) =>
        [parts * each] elem -> [parts][each]elem
    groupBy = split`{parts=parts}

We can pass the `each` argument to `groupBy` positionally, or by name. These two calls are equivalent:

    groupBy`{3}xs
    groupBy`{each=3}xs

but we could instead pass the `parts` argument by name, or positionally as in:

    groupBy`{parts=2}
    groupBy`{_,2}

The former being preferred whenever it makes the code easier to read.

Finally, you can declare type variables in a function declaration, by typing
the function's arguments, like this:

    myWidth (xs:[a]b) = `a

This can help break the Catch-22 situation that sometimes arises when you're
writing a function that needs access to type variables, but you're not yet sure
about the whole function's type signature.

## Type Aliases

Type aliases are only permitted to be defined on curried primitive
types in Cryptol version 2. In Cryptol version 1, for example, tuples
were permitted in type declaration contexts.

## Type Classes

Cryptol version 2 has introduced type classes to enable type constraints to be
more expressive. For example, the type of + in Cryptol version 1 is:

    Cryptol> :t +
    + : {a b} ([a]b,[a]b) -> [a]b

and in Cryptol version 2, the type of + is:

    Cryptol> :t (+)
    + : {a} (Arith a) => a -> a -> a

This latter type says that the arguments of `+` must be things that "arithmetic
can be performed on".

The other type class Cryptol version 2 defines is `Cmp` -- the class of things
that can be compared to each other:

    Cryptol> :t (==)
    == : {a} (Cmp a) => a -> a -> Bit

## Tuple Projection Syntax

In Cryptol version 1, we used the `project` function to extract items out of a tuple.
In Cryptol version 2, we use the same `.` notation as is used to extract items out
of records. Further, the `project` function was 1-based (the first element is at index 1
of the tuple), but the `.` version of project is now 0-based (so the first element is
at index 0 of the tuple). So, in Cryptol version 1:

    Cryptol> project(1,3,(1,2,3))
    1

in Cryptol version 2, becomes:

    Cryptol> (1,2,3).0
    1

## Properties (theorems in version 1)

In version 1, _theorems_ are special syntax attached to function declarations.
In version 2, the `property` keyword can be added to any function that returns
a Bit. All of the arguments to a property are implicitly universally quantified.
So version 1's

    sqDiffThm : ([8], [8]) -> Bit;
    theorem sqDiffThm: {x, y}. sqDiff1 (x, y) == sqDiff2 (x, y);

becomes, in version 2:

    sqDiffThm : ([8], [8]) -> Bit
    property sqDiffThm x y = sqDiff1 (x, y) == sqDiff2 (x, y)

The `property` keyword is just an annotation. You can apply `:check`,
`:exhaust`, `:sat` and `:prove` to any function that returns `Bit`.

# Current Limitations of `:modernize`

If you want to translate a significant codebase written in Cryptol version 1 to
version 2, the `:modernize` command can help a lot. However it doesn't do the
whole job for you. This section describes some limitations and suggests
effective ways of translating your code.

## Syntactic limitations

Currently, `:modernize`:

- doesn't add commas to lists of type variables,
- doesn't automatically translate `take(3,xs)` to `` take`{3}xs ``,
- doesn't translate `**` to `^^`,
- doesn't turn `theorem` declarations into `property`'s.
- doesn't convert tuple `project` to the new `.` syntax

Feature requests have been filed for these limitations.

## Converting Endianness

If your code goes back and forth between numeric constants and sequences (as
much crypto code does), you have already been affected by version 1's choice of
little endianness, in which the "rightmost" bits of the word are the most
significant digits.

    Cryptol> [False False True]
    0x4

Since humans made the (questionable?) decision to write the most-significant
bits _first_ when we write numbers down, many translations of crypto specs
involve frequent use of the `reverse` operator. We have found that Cryptol code
looks closer to most specs when it's in "big endian" mode. This is why version
2 only supports this mode.

The translation between endianness can not be easily mechanized, though, so
`:modernize` doesn't try to.

As a result, our suggested translation path from version 1 to version 2 is either
to completely rewrite the code based on looking at the original spec (which is
likely to produce surprisingly cleaner code), or if that isn't feasible to
first translate the version 1 code to "big endian" mode (use `:set +B`), then
apply `:modernize`, then finally fix up the source based on the limitations
enumerated above. The reason for going this route is that switching endianness
within version 1 lets you use the `:prove` and `:check` operations to verify
the correctness of your logic, then it becomes a simple syntax modernization
task. Doing both at once has proven to be very difficult, and leaves you
without tool support.
