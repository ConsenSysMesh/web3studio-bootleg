# Contributed Examples

These are Cryptol examples submitted by members of the community. If
you build something cool you'd like to share, send us a pull request
and we'll add it here!

A good example includes:

- A link to a description of the algorithm, like a NIST spec or a paper
- Test vectors, if applicable, preferably tested with `property` definitions
- Comments that help readers learn from your example

Note that contributions must be compatible with the BSD3 license we
use for the rest of the releases.
